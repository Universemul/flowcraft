Strategic Roadmap for "Flowchart"
Objective: To transform "Flowchart" from a simple drawing tool into an indispensable partner in the software development lifecycle, ensuring architecture is always up-to-date and easy to understand.

Phase 1: The Foundation – Becoming the Best C4 Editor on the Market
Phase Goal: To create the most intuitive and enjoyable C4 diagram editing experience available. This is the foundation upon which everything else will be built.

1. Feature: Exceptional User Interface & Fluid Experience

Description: An interface, potentially based on React Flow, that is not only beautiful but also fast, responsive, and extremely intuitive. Drag-and-drop, element linking, and navigation between levels must feel seamless and effortless.

User Value: Reduces the friction of adoption. A tool that is enjoyable to use is a tool that will actually be used. This is your primary initial hook.

2. Feature: Guided and Structured C4 Editing

Description: The application shouldn't be a blank canvas. It should actively guide the user in creating their model while respecting the C4 hierarchy (Context > Containers > Components > Code). The interface should clearly indicate the current level and which elements can be added.

User Value: Ensures the consistency and validity of the C4 model, even for those who aren't experts. It lowers the barrier to entry.

3. Feature: "As Code" Export – The Technical Cornerstone

Description: The core of your application. Every architecture created is saved in a human-readable, version-controllable text file format (e.g., architecture.c4.yaml). This file is meant to live inside the project's Git repository.

User Value: This is the feature that unlocks all future potential. It allows architecture to be treated like code, paving the way for automation and continuous integration.

Phase 2: The Integration – Becoming a Developer's Tool
Phase Goal: To embed "Flowchart" into the daily workflow of developers by adopting a "Git-Centric" approach. This is where your main differentiator lies.

1. Feature: Native Git Integration

Description: The application can clone a repository, open an existing architecture.c4.yaml file, allow for its modification through the GUI, and then commit and push the changes directly from the application.

User Value: A seamless experience. The architect or developer doesn't have to juggle between their IDE, the terminal, and your tool.

2. Feature: The "Living Architecture" GitHub Action

Description: Provide a turnkey GitHub Action that, when added to a project, will automatically:

Validate the architecture file on every push/Pull Request.

Generate the visual diagrams (PNG, SVG).

Generate an interactive HTML mini-site for navigation.

Publish these artifacts to GitHub Pages or a wiki.

Comment on Pull Requests with the updated diagrams.

User Value: Solves the #1 problem with documentation: it's never up-to-date. Architecture becomes a verified and automated part of the CI/CD pipeline. This is your killer feature.

Phase 3: The Intelligence – Becoming an Active Partner
Phase Goal: To evolve "Flowchart" from a passive tool into an intelligent assistant that provides insights and improves communication.

1. Feature: Visual Architecture "Diff"

Description: Generate a visual "before/after" comparison of diagrams during a Pull Request. Added elements appear in green, deleted ones in red, and modified ones in yellow.

User Value: Revolutionizes architecture reviews. It makes changes instantly understandable and facilitates more relevant feedback.

2. Feature: Intelligent Architecture Analyzer ("Linter")

Description: Integrate an engine that analyzes the C4 model for anti-patterns (e.g., circular dependencies, "god" containers) and violations of best practices, providing warnings and suggestions directly in the interface.

User Value: Improves the quality of architectures. It educates teams and prevents costly design flaws before they are even coded.

3. Feature: Interactive Storytelling ("Walkthroughs")

Description: Allow users to define and save "scenarios" that animate a data flow or user journey across the different diagrams. The HTML export allows these animations to be replayed.

User Value: A powerful communication and onboarding tool for explaining complex concepts to new hires or non-technical teams.

Phase 4: The Vision – Becoming an Accelerator
Phase Goal: To tackle the most complex problems to deliver exponential value and become an indispensable tool.

1. Feature: Reverse-Engineering Assistant

Description: A tool that scans a project's source code (docker-compose.yml, package.json, pom.xml, etc.) to identify services, databases, and key dependencies. It then suggests these as pre-populated elements to be dragged and dropped onto the C4 canvas.

User Value: Drastically reduces the time and effort required to document an existing application, which is one of the biggest barriers to adopting this type of tool.
